# Documentation

The documentation is generated by [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) with the [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) Theme. MkDocs is a static site generator wich uses Markdown as markup language. For a Markdown cheat sheet click [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet).

## Local build

Use the following command to build a local instance:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```
The documentation can be accessed on the local address shown in the terminal ([http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000))

!!! HINT
    `mkdocs` handles updates of your `.md` code automatically. You don't need to run the command twice when updates are made. Assuming you are still in the same session

## Deploy

When the documentation is ready it can be uploaded to GitHub using:

```bash
mkdocs gh-deploy
```

This will automatically build an upload the site to GitHub using the branch *gh-pages*.

!!! WARNING
    Please avoid modifying the branch *gh-pages* manually.
