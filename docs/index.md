# IoT Framework

This frameworks intention is to simplify the development of ESP32 IoT Devices, which interact with AWS Services. In addition its intentions is to simplify the development of back-end applications based on AWS Lambda functions. The project **IoT Framework** consists of the following repositories: 

* [ESP IoT Framework](https://github.com/ECE-IoT/esp-iot-framework)
* [AWS IoT Framework](https://github.com/ECE-IoT/aws-iot-framework)
* [Grafana Setup for RaspberryPi](https://github.com/ECE-IoT/grafana-iot)
* [Hardware (PCB and Case)](https://github.com/ECE-IoT/hardware)

Every repository has its own docs which are all collected in this landing-page.

## Motivation

### Overview

The networking of sensors and actuators via the internet is becoming increasingly important in industry, but also in the private sector. In this project work it will be shown how a processing chain from the sensor to the cloud service (AWS) can be realized practically. The project aims to provide a valuable overview of what is possible with embedded/connected IoT devices that can transmit data to the cloud. In addition, the projects goal was to provide a secure connection to AWS.
